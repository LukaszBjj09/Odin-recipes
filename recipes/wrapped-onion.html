    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This copycat onion wrapped flying Dutchman is essentially a cheeseburger served in an onion "bun" that is tender, crisp, and sweet, and pairs perfectly well with the richness of the meat.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large white onion</li>
        <li>3/4 pound ground beef round</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 slices American cheese, cut into thirds</li>
        <li>1/4 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sweet pickle relish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <p>Step 1</p>
        <li>Cut 4 1/2 -inch thick slices from the center portion of the onion and discard the smaller ends for another use. Divide beef into 4 portions and form each portion into a very thin patty.  Season patties with salt and pepper.</li>
        <p>Step 2</p>
        <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add 2  onion slices to the pan and cook, undisturbed, about 2 minutes. Add 2 patties and continue to cook until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip onion and burger patties and continue to cook until golden brown pressing the burger as it cooks. 

        </li>
        <p>Step 3</p>
        <li>Add 2 cheese slices to the top of one onion slice and both burger patties. Place one burger on the cheese-topped onion slice and top with the second burger patty. Place remaining onion slice over burger and press down. Flip burger and cook 1 to 2 more minutes. Remove from
            pan and set aside. Repeat with remaining onions, burger patties and
            cheese.  </li>
        <p>Step 4</p>
        <li>Combine mayo, ketchup, mustard, and pickle relish in a small bowl and stir well.  Serve with burgers.
